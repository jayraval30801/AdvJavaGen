How to insert data in database using jsp/servlet...

1) Jsp page create => webapp=>new=>.jsp file
2) jsp page => form tag => action => servlet-name(Ex.addStudentServlet) =>Parameters pass(firstname , email ,password) => button(submit)=>submit press servlet redirect
3) com => controller folder=> class file => create servlet (addStudentServlet) 
4) WEB_INF => web.xml file => servlet-mapping => <servlet ,servlet-mapping , url-pattern.
5) addStudentServlet => request.getparameter(firstname,email,password)
6) Dao => file => StudentDao => create method => insertstudent(firstname,email,password) => DBConnection.openconnection(con object) => mysql=> Prepa state(object) =>query(insert into student (firstname,email,password) value (?,?,?));
6) setString(1,firstname) = >email => pass set => (i=pstmt.executeQuery()/executeUpdate() => query for display data/update for update/insert/delete) then return the i variable 
6) Exception handle try - catch (exception e)
7) Servlet => i.insertStudent(firstname,email,password).=> RequestDispatcher => Jsp => i=1 => success.jsp else fail.jsp 
8) Goto AddStudent.jsp page then run it on server.and check the data is inserted or not.
